BUSINESS DESCRIPTION:
For sale is a fully automated Amazon FBA business specializing in wholesale office supplies, operating for over 5 years with consistent revenue and low overhead. This business is entirely hands-off, with operations managed through a reliable third-party logistics (3PL) partner that handles all inventory, prep, and shipping. Products are replenishable, high-demand SKUs such as printer ink, paper, and filing accessoriesâ€”all sourced through vetted wholesale suppliers with strong terms and low minimum order quantities.

Customer service and delivery are handled by Amazon, and the current owner spends less than an hour per week managing basic oversight and reporting. Standard operating procedures, supplier relationships, and 3PL contacts are included with the sale to ensure a smooth transition. This is an ideal acquisition for a passive investor, aggregator, or Amazon seller looking for a plug-and-play operation with room to scale.

Financial performance has been stable, with healthy profit margins and recurring sales from repeat customers and essential-use products. The business is primed for growth through catalog expansion, optimization of Amazon listings and PPC strategy, or expansion into additional marketplaces like Walmart or international Amazon platforms.

The seller is offering full post-sale training and support, along with documentation of all key workflows, to ensure a seamless transition.
