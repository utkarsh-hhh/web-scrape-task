Business For Sale Details
Listed on Aug 20, 2025
This is a newly accredited home health agency operating in Los Angeles County under a California C-Corporation. The business currently occupies approximately 500 sq. ft. of leased space at a monthly rate of $700, with a lease valid through September 2025. It is fully relocatable, offering buyers operational flexibility based on their strategic needs. *

The agency is accredited by the Accreditation Commission for Health Care (ACHC) with its most recent survey conducted on May 5, 2025. The California Department of Public Health license is current through May 5, 2028. The agency is clean and never billed, with no patient census, no staffing commitments, no ADRs, no liens, and no billing or compliance issues. *

This agency does fall under the 36-month Medicare rule, which must be factored into the buyer’s strategic plan. The entity presents an excellent opportunity for a healthcare operator looking for an early-stage platform to grow in the Los Angeles market with a compliant foundation and fresh credentials. There is no EMR system in place, which offers the buyer complete discretion in choosing operational tools. No FFE or inventory is included in the transaction. *

The seller will not consider SBA 7(a) financing or seller-carry options. All-cash offers only. All reasonable offers will be considered. The seller is prepared to assist with the transition process and provide guidance and support with any necessary onboarding or compliance setup to help the buyer move forward confidently. *

With strong demand for home health agencies in the Los Angeles region, this opportunity provides an efficient entry into the market for those with referral sources and infrastructure in place. The lack of operational or financial baggage positions the business as a compliant and affordable springboard for growth. *

The home health market in Southern California continues to be competitive, but buyers with established networks and a scalable care model can leverage this license’s clean record and strategic location to expand rapidly. Immediate opportunities include building referral partnerships, staffing up, and launching compliant care operations in one of the most active healthcare markets in the state. *

Seller Preferences: (1) Possess healthcare experience, particularly in operating a home health agency or similar agency, (2) provide verifiable proof of funds for the transaction, and (3) have access to patient referral sources and a network of licensed healthcare professionals.

Seller Recommendations: (1) Buyer should possess the capability to generate patient referrals, (2) Buyer should have access to the necessary professional team members, (3) It is advised that the buyer engages a professional team (e.g., Medicare Consultant, Accountant, Attorney) to assist with due diligence and review processes.

Buyer Requirements: (1) All prospective buyers must sign a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) and (2) Proof of Funds is required from all potential buyers.

Due Diligence: All in-depth due diligence beyond the Confidential Information Memorandum (CIM) will require the Buyer to submit either a Letter of Intent (LOI) or a Purchase Agreement.
